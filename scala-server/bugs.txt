      java.util.ConcurrentHashMap

      ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html

      ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize, ThreadFactory threadFactory, RejectedExecutionHandler handler)

        ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)

  Then just use the logic from Haskell.

- Passes should be shown in the running list as just -- 
  rather than blank.

- When first play is a machine play and it is a pass,
  both client and server should do the right thing. Client has
  to make sure user move is centered.
