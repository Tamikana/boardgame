- Later version. package scala client library and use it in a java client.
  The benchmark can then be done in terms of the scala client library.

- Use smaller amazon machine. m3.large worked well.

- Create cleanup scripts for docker container and image.

- App logs in docker should go to the data area so you can see them easily from the

- Word frequencies:

    Unfortunately this is not a clean set. I'd say about 50% are non-words. So give up on that.

- https://www.wordfrequency.info/purchase.asp $250.00 for 100K words

    This is a clean list. But 100K is too few. The least frequent words are
    still relatively common.

- Truncate nohup.out on production machine.

- The port number for docker has to be specified redundantly in a couple of
  docker scripts. Make it dry if possible.

- Controller test is flaky because it has a timeout.
