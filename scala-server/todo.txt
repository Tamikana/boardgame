- After a linux shutdown without shutting down the docker container,
  when the system comes back up we get this message:

  This application is already running (Or delete /home/me/dev/boardgame/scala-server/dist/scala-server-1.0/RUNNING_PID file).

  -Dpidfile.path=/var/run/boardgame-scala/RUNNING_PID

  You'll have to sudo mkdir -p /var/run/boardgame-scala/ and chown to the current user.

  For now just docker rm thecontainer and rerun.

- Indicate that first move has to be to the center.

- Word frequencies:

    Downloaded to /Users/azadbolour/Downloads/count_1w.txt.

  Intersect with Moby first. Then add parameter - maxWords - only the most 
  frequent words up to the max would be used.

  Credit Norvig.

- Truncate nohup.out on production machine.

- The port number specification is not dry. Make it so if possible.

- controller test is flaky because it has a timeout of 1 sec. Change to 3.

- On redhat trying to build the packager docker file:

  WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
  openjdk-8-jre-headless openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk-headless openjdk-8-jdk
  E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes

- Move current docker directory to haskell-server.

- Update root level README file.

- Upgrade Haskell server.

- Change docker names to reflect type of server -
  
    azadbolour/haskell-boardgame:0.2
