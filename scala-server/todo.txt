- Add more scorer tests. Add crosswordfilder tests.
  Copy from Haskell.

- TODO. For now just comment that strips have blanks where the board has null
  chars.  
  
- TODO. Check the maching algorithm to make sure it is everywhere using
  blanks. 

- Document the matching algorithm.

- Write test for final score.

- Use smaller amazon machine. m3.large worked well.

- Create cleanup scripts for docker container and image.

- App logs in docker should go to the data area so you can see them easily from the
  outside.

- Word frequencies:

    Unfortunately this is not a clean set. I'd say about 50% are non-words. So give up on that.

- https://www.wordfrequency.info/purchase.asp $250.00 for 100K words
  https://www.wordfrequency.info/files/entries.pdf 
    This is a clean list. But 100K is too few. The least frequent words are
    still relatively common.

  Can just use that for the machine play, and use Moby to check user plays.

- Truncate nohup.out on production machine.

- The port number for docker hs to be specified redundantly in a couple of
  docker scripts. Make it dry if possible.

- controller test is flaky because it has a timeout of 1 sec. Change to 3.

- On redhat trying to build the packager docker file:

  WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!

- Update root level README file.
