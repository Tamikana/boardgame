- Board.legalMove numTrayPieces - fix comment.

  Board.lineMoveInfo returns hasInterMOveAnchor and other info. 
  Then isCompletable decides if legal. If no inline anchor,
  then you need a cross anchor. At least one move that touches
  an existing tile crosswise. If you have that then you need to 
  have enough tiles for intermove slots. 

  For one point along the line that touches a neighbor you should 
  either have an existing move, or add a move there and then 
  have enough times to complete the play.
  
  Need move.anchoredCrosswise

  But this is getting very complicated. Maybe easiest to require that 
  all moves be adjacent to an existing tile. Simpler to code and simpler
  for the user to understand.

- Add error boundary.

- Using fragments <> </> instead of divs??

- Change all code to use module pattern rather than classes.

- Make sure production version uses sanctioned code.

- Clean up mock api.
