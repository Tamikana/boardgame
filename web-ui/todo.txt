- adding one letter Q to the right of an existing lone letter I  at the left
  edge of the board 

  the playpieces found by the UI had only Q

  need a test for extnding a letter by one letter and make sure te word
  includes both letters

  it thought that the Q was a parallel play - so in the case of 1 line of play 
  at each axis you need to get one in which the played tile has an adjacent tile

  the case wher ether eis only one move is special - if no neighbors
  disconnected - a neighbor determines the direction - just extend it
  in both directions and check size

- Target container is not a DOM element error in browser console.

  Both main and index include the script. Only one should I think.

  I ran into this same error, and as others have suggested, it's because your
  bundle.js file is loading too early. Move your <script> tag into the body (as
  the last line before the closing </body> tag) to resolve this error. â€“

- Make clear where the new word is placed by machine.

- Indicate that it is user's turn to drag.

- Catch and log UI errors at highest level - and send to server if possible -
  indicate error id in UI asking user to report.

- Help for the app.

- Add error boundary.

- Using fragments <> </> instead of divs??

- Change all code to use module pattern rather than classes.

- Make sure production version uses sanctioned code.
