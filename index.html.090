<div style="font-size: 35px; color: #009FFF; text-align: center">Board Game</div>

<p>
A board game in the crosswords genre.

<p>
Showcasing Haskell and Scala game servers and a React drag and drop web UI.

Currently in version 0.9 alpha trial for modern browsers on the MAC, Linux,
and Windows platforms (not yet supported on smart phones and tablets).

The board game project is intended primarily as a test bed for experimentation
with different languages and framework for application development and
deployment. 

The rules may change over time as interesting variations are discovered with
usage.

<p>

Drag and drop letters to form a word connected to an existing tile
on the board and click <em>Commit Play</em> to play that word. 

<h2>Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Values are associated with board locations - not with letters. 

<li>
The assignment of values to board locations varies from game to game.

<li>
A word play accumulates the points of the [new] locations it captures.

<li>
A word play on a non-empty board must contain at least one existing letter.

<li>
A word play on an empty board is unrestricted.

<li>
Tray letters are chosen randomly based on the frequency of 
letters in words of the English language 
(per <a href="http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/353"/>). 
There is no notion of a container of letters getting depleted.

<li>
When no play is possible, a single letter is swapped for another.
A game ends upon 10 consecutive swaps. 

<li>
Games have a time limit of 1 hour. Longer games are considered 
abandoned and are harvested.

</ul>

<h2>Noteworthy</h2>

You may wish to install a dictionary plugin in your browser to 
easily search for the meanings of words played by the machine.

Make sure the status field below the the board is visible in 
your browser.

The board's dimension is configurable through the URL query 
parameter <em>dimension</em>. Valid values are odd numbers
between 5 and 25 inclusive (default 17).

The letter tray size is configurable through the URL query
parameter <em>tray-capacity</em> (in the range [3 .. 15],
default 8).

<h2>Issues</h2>

On rare occasions a word you play may be missing from the game's
dictionary. This should happen rarely enough to be tolerable.
The dictionary is supposed to include common English words 
(it excludes many technical terms). 

Use the <a href="https://github.com/azadbolour/boardgame/issues">
development project's issues list</a> for to report missing 
common words and any other issues you may run into.
