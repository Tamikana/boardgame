## Express Web Server for Experimention with Javascript/CSS/HTML

### Getting Started

Follow the [installation instructions](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).
And install any additional packages needed, e.g., 

`npm install path --save`
`npm install morgan --save`

Add file index.js to this directory. This is what brings up express.
Just follow boilerplate.

Good tutorial for using ES6. Just FYI for later use.
