<div style="font-size: 35px; color: #009FFF; text-align: center">Board Game</div>

<p>
A board game akin to other well-known board games but different in a number of
ways.

<p>
Showcasing Haskell and Scala game servers and a React drag and drop web UI.

Currently in version 0.5 beta trial for modern browsers on the MAC, Linux,
and Windows platforms (not yet supported on smart phones and tablets).

The board game project is intended primarily as a test bed for experimentation
with different languages and framework for application development and
deployment. 

As such, the structure and rules of the game may change in different versions 
of the board game as new and useful variations are discovered and 
suggested by users.

Drag and drop letters to form a word connected to an existing tile
on the board and click <em>Commit Play</em> to play that word. 

Games have a time limit of 30 minutes. Longer games are considered 
abandoned and are harvested.
