<div style="font-size: 35px; color: #009FFF; text-align: center">Board Game</div>

<p>
A board game akin to scrabble with simpler rules. 

<p>
Showcasing a Haskell game server and a React drag and drop UI.

Currently in version 0.2 alpha trial. 

<p>

Drag and drop letters to form a word connected to an existing tile
on the board and click <em>Commit Play</em> to play that word.

<h4>Rules</h4>

The board game is not intended to closely mimic scrabble. The rules are 
simpler, and may evolve over time, but not necessarily in the 
direction of scrabble. Here are a few differences.

<ul>

<li>
Scoring is simplified: the score for a play is the total length of 
the word constructed in the principle direction of the play 
(horizonatl or vertical). 

<li>
Tiles are selected randomly <em>with replacement</em> 
(unlike scrabble in which tiles are selected randomly <em>without
replacement</em>). The probability distribution of letters is not 
necessarily that of scrabble.

<li>
Cross words are not checked - only the word in the principle direction. 
This is a known issue.

<li>
A game needs to be explicitly ended by the user.

<li>
Games have a time limit of 30 minutes. Longer games are considered 
abandoned and are harvested.
